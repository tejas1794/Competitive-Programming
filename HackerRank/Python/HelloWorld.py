Problem Statement

Python is an interactive language that allows us to execute statements individually and see their results. In other words, you don't have to write a full code and compile it before you see the results as in other languages like C++ and Java.

Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:

print "Hello World!" 
You can even store the string in a variable and then print it:

my_string = "Hello World!"
print my_string
The above code will print Hello World! on your screen. You can try it in the console below.

P.S. Do try Solve Me First and Solve Me Second in Python before moving ahead.

#write your code in next line. 
print "Hello World!"
